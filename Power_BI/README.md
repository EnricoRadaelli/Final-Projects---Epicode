# Project: Olist Store BI Reporting

**Description**

This project aims to create a comprehensive Business Intelligence (BI) report for the Olist Store, a Brazilian e-commerce platform for sellers. The public dataset, spanning from 2016 to 2018, provides details on sales orders that allow for in-depth analysis across multiple dimensions such as customer, product, payment methods, and order status.

The final BI report will allow stakeholders to make informed decisions by visually presenting key metrics and trends identified from the Olist dataset. The report will be dynamic, allowing users to filter and interact with the data based on specific requirements.

**Main Tasks**

- Reduce the dataset volume to enhance performance;
- Transform raw data into a star schema format to facilitate efficient querying;
- Incorporate a calendar dimension for time-based analysis;
- Create visualizations to track monthly order trends and revenue by state, with the ability to compare year-over-year changes and filter by order status;
- Calculate revenue by adding product price and freight costs from the dataset;
- Analyze customer feedback by incorporating the distribution of review ratings;
- Design an intuitive report layout and user experience with features like buttons and drill-through capabilities for detailed data exploration;
- Ensure the report includes additional analysis such as product and geographical area reviews to provide richer insights.
